# SublimeText project files
*.sublime-workspace
# *.sublime-project
#     If you only want to use the project on your computer, rather than
#     share the Sublime Text project configuration with others, you may
#     need to disable the *.sublime-project line by making it to a comment
#     line or delete that line.
